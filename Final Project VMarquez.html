    <h1>The Grief of Family</h1>
    <h2>By Victoria Marquez</h2>
    <p>The story is about a family who must attend a funeral due to the passing a beloved family member. I made this story to show empasis on how grief is an emotion that everyone must face in life and how nobody is prepared for the time someone they care for, will pass away in the future.</p>
